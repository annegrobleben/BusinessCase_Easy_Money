This repository contains three notebooks that were created as part of the final project for a Master in Data Science & AI at Nuclio Digital School. This final project is a business case to help company "easyMoney" 
understand their customers and run a Direct Marketing campaign. The business case contains several subtasks, and the notebooks in this repository are related to data analysis, customer segmentation and model building.

1) Data_analysis_active_inactive_and_socioeconomic:
This notebook is about analyzing easyMoney's customers based on their activity status and their socioeconomic data.

2) Segmentation:
In this notebook the customers are split into eight groups with the help of a clustering model. Important: The csv-file "df_merged.csv", which is used later in the notebook "Model_financing_products"
is created during the segmentation.

3) Model_financing_products:
This notebook aims at creating a classification model used to identify potential recipients for the Direct Marketing campaign.

All three notebooks were created in Google Colab. To run them, the zipped folder "easyMoney_data" needs to be downloaded from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15PJnym2OQMrYzZVq97IA_bc6s7uAZPzj?usp=sharing and then uploaded in "MyDrive". To run the notebooks in an application other than Google Colab the second and third code cells in each of the notebooks would need to be adjusted accordingly.
